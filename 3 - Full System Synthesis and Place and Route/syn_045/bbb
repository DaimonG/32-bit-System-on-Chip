# Specifying Technology Libraries Design constraints

# We use SLOW timing libraries for worst case timing estimation and fix timing (Setup) in worst possible case
# Please note (1): TARGET_LIBRARY    libraries that can be used for synthesis, so the tool can CHOOSE TO USE THEM to implement your VHDL
#                  LINK_LIBRARY      libraries than can be linked by the tool, that is used by the designer in his design, but not CHOSEN by the tool
#                                    Example: Memory blocks, or a pre-layouted block or a standard cell explicitly defined by the designer in HDL 
#                  SYNTHETIC_LIBRARY Synthetic or DesignWare libraries. These slibraries are technology-independent, microarchitecture-level 
#                                    design libraries offered by synopsys and providing pre-packaged implementations for various IP blocks.
#                                    They differ from target libraries in that they are technology independent and contain operators 
#                                    (ex. Multiplier, adder etc) instead of cells
# Please Note (2) : Sometimes, for simplicity, these variables are set in a configuration file (.synopsys_dc.setup that is read by dc_shell at init

# After Logic synthesis has been performed, the logic functionality of the HDL is known. With the following step, 
# the functionality is mapped over the available standard cells, in order to produce a netlist that will represent 
# the technology implementation of the HDL functionality
# Since as we know the synthesis process is driven by our CONSTRAINTS, before we perform technology mapping we need to specify the constraints 
# to our design. In particular, we must impose TIMINGS.
# If we specify nothing, the tool will produce the smallest AREA not considering timing
